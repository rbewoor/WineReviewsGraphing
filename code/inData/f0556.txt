Discovery Vineyard Cab makes up most of this wine, with just a splash of Champoux vineyard Franc to fill it out. Very pretty, very focused aromas of spice box, red and black fruit and herb are followed by a fruit-forward, shamelessly appealing yet still elegant, balanced palate that puts a premium on purity, with a well integrated structure surrounding it all.
