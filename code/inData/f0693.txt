Made with Sangiovese blended with 10% Ciliegiolo and 5% Alicante Bouschet, this savory wine opens with aromas of underbrush, ripe berry, tobacco leaf and Mediterranean herb. The vibrant, refined palate doles out juicy black cherry, crushed raspberry, orange peel, licorice and white pepper alongside supple tannins. It closes on a mineral note. Enjoy through 2020.
