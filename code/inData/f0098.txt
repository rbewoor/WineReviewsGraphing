A wisp of bramble extends a savory tone from nose to finish on this otherwise bright bristling wine. Delicate honey tones register as off dry on the palate but balance neatly alongside flavors of freshly pressed apples and pears. The finish is marked by a touch of pencil lead. Drink now through 2020.
