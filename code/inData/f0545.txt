From Paso's blending vanguards, this mix of 62% Syrah, 19% Petite Sirah, 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6% Malbec offers an intriguing nose of sesame, soy, cracked pepper, fresh blackberry and raw beef. There is cedar and toasted pine on the palate as well as smoked meats, black pepper, teriyaki and an elderberry-blackberry base.
