Etienne Le Riche is a total Cabernet specialist. With a tiny production of 5,000 cases across all his wines, this is boutique in the best sense. The Reserve Cabernets are, of course, the stars. This 2003 is fruit and wood driven, a powerful but still elegant wine, with black plums, tannins and super-ripe fruits.
