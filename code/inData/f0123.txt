Defines Rockpile Zinfandel in intensity of fruit and high alcohol which is in keeping with the volume. There are few red wines in the world like this. It's fully dry, with potent flavors of baked blackberries, blackcurrants, cola and peppery spices, and the tannins are huge, but negotiable. Demands the richest grilled meats and cheeses.
