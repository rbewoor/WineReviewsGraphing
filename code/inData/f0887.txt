This Grenache-heavy blend (with 20% Syrah) offers a good amount of bittersweet cocoa powder and rich jammy black berries and all-fruit preserves on the nose and mouth. A hint of gaminess adds interest to the bouquet, while the crushed velvet texture and firm tannins transition into a long finish laced with earthy spice.
