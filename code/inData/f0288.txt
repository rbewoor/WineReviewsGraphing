This is the stud in the Acústic stable. A blend of 70% Carignan and 30% Garnacha, Braó is lively and bright on the nose, with ripe blackberry and cassis aromas. The palate is concentrated and juicy, with fine balance and bold flavors of blueberry, blackberry and coffee. A toasty, dark finish features chocolate, toast and minerality. Drink through 2019.
