This classic, iconic Pinotage opens with dense aromas of pressed purple violets, forest berries, raspberry sauce and fudge brownie. The lush and decadent palate offers more of the same, with a crushed velvet texture and final notes of licorice and toasted spice that linger long. It's delicious now, but should hold well through 2022.
