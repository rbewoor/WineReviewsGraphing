This wine opens with a confectionary nose, slowly unleashing its thick, concentrated richness of dark cherry and cassis on the palate. Between the layers are grippy tannins and shakes of meaty leather and black pepper. This could stand some time in a decanter or swirling in the glass before enjoying.
