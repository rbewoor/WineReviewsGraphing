Beautiful deep gold color. Intense, concentrated nose with vibrant aromas of honey, citrus marmalade and savory botrytis notes. Deliciously sweet and succulent, yet balanced by good acidity.  Packed with flavors of sweet ultra-ripe stone and tropical fruit, with honey and botrytis notes following through. Strong minerality prevails to a long, complex finish.
