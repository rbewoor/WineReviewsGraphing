The Dillons Point subregion of Marlborough often produces particularly pungent examples of Sauvignon Blanc, but this wine doesn't quite hew to that mold. The herbal notes are prominent but well mannered, backed by plenty of mild citrus—think white grapefruit—and melon. Ample weight, a silky texture and a lengthy finish complete the package.
