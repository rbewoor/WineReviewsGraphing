Bradley Brown's appellation blend is a nice entry point to this exciting winery. This wine shows lavish smoked black currant and plum flavors, with aromatically lifting spices of anise and black pepper and a savory roast-beef element. The palate packs lots of pepper and relies on plump black cherry, boysenberry and a dark-chocolate syrup richness.
