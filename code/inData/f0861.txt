Fresh cracked peppercorn, dense black and purple fruit and a cedar tone carry through the nose of this lavish yet nuanced bottling from a South Coast winery that practices extended aging before release. The elderberry fruit is hung on a strong tannic structure, bolstered by woody cigar box, incense, juniper and espresso flavors.
