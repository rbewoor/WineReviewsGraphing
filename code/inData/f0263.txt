Beaver Creek makes a variation of Fairytale every vintage and this one, sourced from Napa Valley, is 41% Merlot, 36% Zinfandel and 23% Syrah, a mix that seems to work very nicely here. The wine's Zin almost tastes as if it has mountain tannins; the wine is overall herbal and earthy, ripe and sturdy with balanced fruit.
