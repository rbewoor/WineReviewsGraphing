This amber-colored Hungarian stunner has ethereal aromas of raw honey, beeswax, freshly baked tarte Tatin, canned apricot and fresh pear. It is silky smooth and creamy in the mouth with pronounced flavors of clover honey, pear tart and baked sweet apples. The acidity is perfectly balanced so you can appreciate its velvety richness without feeling that the sweetness is too cloying.
