Aromas of dark chocolate, dried and fresh herbs, raspberries and black cherry predominate on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Creamy, rich and focused, it has a pleasing sense of texture and vanilla flavors that carry across the finish. It's truly a standout wine at this price.
