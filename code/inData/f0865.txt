Quite rare in the U.S. market, this ripe richly berried wine is an excellent example of Fr√ºhburgunder, an early ripening mutation of Pinot Noir. Blackberry and plum flavors are fleshy and rich, offset by soft, sunny acidity and a supple silken mouthfeel. It's just faintly tannic and approachable now.
