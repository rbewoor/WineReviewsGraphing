A landmark wine for those who love Italian sparklers, this shows loads of ripe apricot, melon and honey notes, with toasted nut and baked bread hints in the background. There are also touches of caramel and butterscotch that help move the wine's thick and opulent texture across the palate. It ends with refreshing acidity and tonic perlage.
