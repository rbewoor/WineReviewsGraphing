It's always a treat to discover a good, well-made but not overpowering wine. This one has nothing in excess, just moderate and crisp fruit flavors with light spicy accents. An appetizing texture backed by good acidity leads to a clean, dry finish. This unoaked wine from northern California should be a crowd pleaser.
