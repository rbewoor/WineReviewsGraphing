Packaged in a heavy, oversized black bottle, this brawny wine delivers power, bulging muscle and aromas that exaggerate in every way possible. The most noticeable feature (so noticeable, it knocks you in the face) is the wood element that comes off as fresh carpentry or wood shavings. The wine is heavy, syrupy and sweet tasting.
