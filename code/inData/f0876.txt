The latest release from the partnership between the Roquette family of Quinta do Crasto in the Douro and the Cazes family of Ch√¢teau Lynch-Bages in Bordeaux. The wine brings out considerable minerality, a herbal edge along with forward black currant fruit. It is austerely structured at this stage and needs aging for several years.
