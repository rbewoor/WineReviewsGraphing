This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020.
