Pretty dark in color and full bodied for a sparkling wine, even one that's majority Pinot Noir. But it's delicious and dry, which surely are prime requisites for any bubbly. Shows ripe, flashy raspberry, strawberry, orange, vanilla, honey, yeast and toast flavors, and the mouthfeel is silky and refined.
