Here's an enticing Vino Nobile offering aromas of underbrush, tobacco leaf, ripe cherry and spice. The palate delivers succulent black cherry, plum, cinnamon and nutmeg along with velvety tannins. Although it shows the warmth of the vintage, it still retains elegance and class. Delicatio Wines, Golden Vines.
