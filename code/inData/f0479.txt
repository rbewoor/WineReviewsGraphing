This is a superior vintage Champagne that is just beginning to mature. Crisp white and citrus fruits are beginning to fade into mature toast and cookie flavors, but the wine maintains its zesty texture. Drink this wine now, but beware the cork is secured precariously with string that must be cut to open.
