Smoky and intense from the get-go, this saturated, black-as-night Malbec is full of blackberry, cassis and gamy aromas. While it goes heavy on the gas, the wine's structure is up to it. Flavors of chocolate, burnt toast, salt and blackberry finish toasty and long, with savory blackened spice notes. Drink through 2023.
