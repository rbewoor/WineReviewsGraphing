At first this is aggressive, with an aromatic note of wet dog along with blueberries. But soon it finds its legs and opens to display chocolate, espresso and a big batch of black plum and blackberry. The finish has full tannins and some coffee-like flavor. Currently it's wall-to-wall big, but it should settle down in no time and become a good red to drink on any occasion.
