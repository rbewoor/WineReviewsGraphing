One of a crop of new Oregon sparklers, this was barrel fermented with native yeast and aged for 56 months prior to disgorging. Fine tiny bubbles and a fresh, yeasty aroma introduce the wine, which has excellent concentration. Green apple and green banana, a touch of cucumber and a nice toasty frame all combine gracefully. The odds are that this will continue to improve in bottle for another five years at least.
