Haven't seen this unusual combination of grapes in quite some time, and you know what, it's much better now than when we last saw it in 2001. This vintage has a nice, almost magnetic nose, while the palate is firm and well structured, with cassis, black cherry, coffee and licorice flavors. It's a bit boring on the finish, but the mouthfeel and length are just fine. Fruity, rich and balanced. 325 cases made.
