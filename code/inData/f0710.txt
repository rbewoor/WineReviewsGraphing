Only the second vintage of this vineyard-designate wine from an estate property, this bottling offers spicy cherry, black tea and dried herb, backed by oaky backbone and structure. Dark chocolate and leather play on the palate in subtle waves, hitting their strides on the finish. Cellar through 2020.
