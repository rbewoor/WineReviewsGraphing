Frosted aromas of orange creamsicle, lychee and melon give this an elevated, unique sort of bouquet. Among Chilean Gew√ºrztraminers, this is one of the more expressive ones you'll find. Pineapple, mango and other tropical flavors are pleasant, while the feel is forward and fun. Drink this summer with fish and salads.
