A very subdued nose suggests some dried orange peel but the palate is full of life: there is bracing, bright and lemon-scented acidity on the dry palate and drenched stone. There is concentration and a texture of the finest, purest citrus oil. This is wonderfully mature and ready now but has the stuffing to last. Drink 2016â€“2020.
