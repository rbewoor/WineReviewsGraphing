This is a big, brawny expression of Grenache, Mourv√®dre, Syrah and Counoise, the Grenache playing the dominant role in the blend. It coats the palate in dense raspberry and blueberry fruit, seasoned with pepper and nutmeg. A leathery touch to the texture and lifted acidity keeps it from feeling heavy or overdone.
