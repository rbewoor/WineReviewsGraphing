Bright pomegranate and dried strawberry notes start the aromas on this bottling and then descend into more brooding cola, smoked herbs, cinnamon and spicy hibiscus. There is herbal and mineral depth to the palate, with raspberry, cranberry and pencil lead flavors that evolve toward fruit punch, thyme and earth. It's light in body but full of grippy texture.
