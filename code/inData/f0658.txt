The 2011 Night Sky shows more earthy character than the 2012, as upfront aromas of soil, blackberry leaf and pepper are grounded by ripe fruit tones of black currant, plum and mulberry. Medium weight on the palate, with velvety tannins that grip through the long, spicy finish. The dense, tight mouthfeel, firm structure and overall balance suggest this wine will age well through 2022.
