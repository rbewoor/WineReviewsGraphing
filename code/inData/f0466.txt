Morar is a spicy Amarone with a fragrance of raisin, baked plum, tobacco and black pepper. The palate delivers lush black cherry and raspberry flavors mingled with intense white pepper, clove and nutmeg notes. It's smooth and rich with enough freshness to make this a perfect match for seasoned cheeses or roasted red meat.
