This would be a straightforward Bordeaux red blend if not for the 5% Petite Sirah within. Together, it's 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and 2% Malbec as well, sourced from Howell Mountain and valley floor sites. Dusty and herbal, the wine is thick and sizably tannic, with dense black fruit, leather and coffee.
