The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine. Lots of toasty new oak adds buttered toast and vanilla, but the wood influence is in balance. Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent.
