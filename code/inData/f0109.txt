Lots of spearmint, coyote mint, hot licorice, ginger snaps and Dr Pepper spice up the strawberry fruit of this wine that provides a very herbal take on the grape. Oregano, marjoram, thyme and dill all make a showing on the sip, against a backbone of sweet cherry and blackberry fruit, finishing on cedar.
