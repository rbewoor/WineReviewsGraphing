For an under-$15 red blend, Corte has it going on. It's rich and full, almost syrupy on the nose, with lots of oak, ink and vanilla. Shows power and packs a punch, with dark berry, chocolate and spicy flavors. A little tannic and scratchy, but with structure and framework to spare. Malbec (80%), with Bonarda and Petit Verdot.
