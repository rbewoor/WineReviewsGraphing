This is a highly particular, funky blend of 85% Malbec and 15% Cabernet. It opens with savory stewy earthy aromas of berry fruits and prune. Due to the 15.5% abv, this feels heavy and clampy, with rooty flavors of baked berry fruits, cola, minty herbs and carob. An oaky spicy toasty finish with heat is the closing act on this fully stuffed Salta blend.
