Medium-gold in color. Complex and inviting nose layered with a strong earthy minerality, vibrant bright fruit and intriguing notes of petrol and honey. On the palate it is racy, taut and focused full of well defined ripe succulent citrus and stone fruit. Rich, viscous texture perfectly balanced by the wine's crispness and almost steely minerality. Very long, juicy, lingering finish.
