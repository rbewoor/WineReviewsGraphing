This deep-colored, full-bodied red gets a little swagger in its step from enticing smoky oak aromas and powerful black-fruit flavors that also carry that spicy oak streak. This is brash enough for slow-cooked barbecue but sophisticated enough for osso buco. The texture is fine-grained from supportive tannin, and the finish lingers. Best now through 2018.
