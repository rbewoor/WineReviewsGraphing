This 23-acre-estate is situated in the south of the Margaux appellation, close to classed growth Ch√¢teau Giscours. While not classified, it still has the ability to produce a fine ripe wine that also has great structure. Acidity and firm tannins are very present along with concentrated blackberry fruits. Drink this fine wine from 2019.
