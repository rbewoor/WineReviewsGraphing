Einaudi's wines have been improving lately, and this Barolo was very impressive, given the trying conditions of the vintage. Big rich, fat with smoked meat and a good dose of oak, the wine was one of the few that didn't peter out early but stayed on the palate to the end, culminating in an nice easy finish.
