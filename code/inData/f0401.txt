Tonic and lean with a nearly transparent color and lively perlage, this non-DOC Prosecco offers candy-like aromas of butterscotch and lemon soda. There's an interesting touch of crushed white peppercorn in there as well and this well-priced wine would make a perfect match to appetizers and finger foods.
