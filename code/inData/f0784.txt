This is dry, rich, heady, spicy and utterly delicious. As usual, it contains a splash of Petite Sirah. Already throwing some sediment, it's pretty tannic, with complex flavors of wild blackberry and blueberry, black currant, licorice, cola, bacon and plum sauce, with a hint of exotic pepper and spice. This great Zinfandel is a joy to drink.
