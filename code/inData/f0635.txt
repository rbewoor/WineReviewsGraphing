From a two-acre block within the amazing Maple Vineyard planted in 1910, this wine also contains 10% Petite Sirah and 10% mixed blacks. Baked berry pie comes to mind first, conjuring up all things good and right in the world, topped in bourbon whipped cream and nutmeg. Good acidity buoys the proceedings. Drink now through 2021.
