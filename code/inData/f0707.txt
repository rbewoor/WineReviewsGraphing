Very fruity and fresh, this wine has crisp apples as well as red fruit giving it a bright, delicious feeling. The acidity goes right through the wine, giving a beautifully fresh feel that points up the fragrant raspberries. Vineyards are in the heart of the sandy soils of the Saint Tropez peninsula.
