Winemaker Dennis Martin puts grape grower Stephen Miller's signature on this wine, a nod to the importance of this historic vineyard. The wine shows bright strawberry and raspberry with touch of savory wood smoke as well as hibiscus-laced pastry and a pinch of thyme. Earthy sagebrush and wild herb flavors frame the palate, where cooked cherries and cranberries are spiced by cardamom and dried ginger spice.
