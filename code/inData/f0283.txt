This delicious blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot opens with an intense, brooding fragrance of dark fruit, spice and leather. The palate delivers a concentrated black-cherry flavor that's framed by big, chewy tannins and  punctuated by spicy accents of white and black pepper, licorice and pipe. Drink 2015â€“2024.
