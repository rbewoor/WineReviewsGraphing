Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) consults here. This brings a blend of clones from the estate vineyard, with ample new wood still showing through. Black fruits and a vein of coffee are also in the mix, with a balanced, somewhat muscular mouthfeel. This has the strength to stand up to a lightly blackened grilled seafood filet.
