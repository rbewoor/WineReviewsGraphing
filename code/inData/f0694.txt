Although the fine mountain site straddles both Napa and Sonoma, this wine's fruit is all Sonoma, the bulk of it Cabernet Franc, with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dried cranberry shows on the nose and palate, followed by chalky tannins and a refined use of oak, finishing in a bite of currant and cherry. Enjoy through 2017.
