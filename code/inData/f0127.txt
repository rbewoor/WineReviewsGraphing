Mid-gold color. Pronounced and enticing aromas of ripe citrus and stone fruit, layered with honey and floral notes with a touch of sweet spice. Rich and creamy texture packed with sweet ripe juicy fruit, honey, spice and a twist of sage. Off-dry, deliciously smooth with fresh acidity and medium-body. An elegant wine with a long, creamy, spicy finish.
