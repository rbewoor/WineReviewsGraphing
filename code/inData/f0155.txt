Ripe aromas of raisin, black plum and horsehide are pointy and peppery. On the palate, this Graciano is bold and energetic, with lifting acidity. Loud berry flavors come with strong accents of dark chocolate and bitter espresso, while the finish is long but just moderate in complexity. Drink through 2020.
