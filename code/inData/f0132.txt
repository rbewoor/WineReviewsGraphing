Attractive mid-gold color. Compelling layers of tangy citrus and stone fruit aromas with notes of honey and earthy minerality. Intense flavors of honey, tangy orange citrus, sweet peach and apricot that are both rich and juicy.  Crisp acidity provides a perfect balance for the slight sweetness on the finish. Taut and focused.
