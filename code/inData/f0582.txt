This one-of-a-kind in the state wine was fermented on skins for 12 days, giving it a light-orange color. The aromas leap up from the glass, with notes of spice, lychee, orange peel and mineral. The palate is dry and textured, with a rich but still sleek feel. Put it on the dinner table to see it shine.
