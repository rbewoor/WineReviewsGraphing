Impressive for its depth and deliciousness. The grapes are from Cline's estate on the Sonoma side of the Carneros district. The wine is dry, full-bodied and tannic, although you can drink it now. It's very rich in blackberries, currants, mushu plum sauce, grilled beef and smoky sandalwood, and seems at its best now.
