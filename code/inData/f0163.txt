More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018â€“2034.
