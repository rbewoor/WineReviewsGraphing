This bottling belongs to a series of wines from the legendary Jerry Lohr emphasizing Rh√¥ne varieties. It shows candied blackberry, violets and potpourri on the fruity, flowery and inviting nose. The palate leads with savory black pepper, which accents its core of black plum, blackberry and purple flower flavors.
