This bottling resembles the New Zealand paradigm of Sauvignon Blanc, bearing aromas of grapefruit, passion fruit and kiwi; a sprinkling of graham cracker adds interest. The wine hits the palate like a fleshy fist, with an intense, grassy gooseberry flavor that provides plenty of punch. Pair with apricot-glazed roasted chicken.
