After a few minutes in the glass, this stunning wine opens up to reveal classic Nebbiolo aromas of leather, tilled soil, underbrush, fragrant blue flower and ripe berry. The juicy concentrated palate dishes out layers of succulent black cherry, crushed raspberry, anise and pipe tobacco framed in firm, velvety tannins. Drink 2022â€“2035.
