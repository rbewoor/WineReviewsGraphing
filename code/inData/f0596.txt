This is a true pan-Washington Cabernet, with fruit coming from 12 different vineyards scattered across the Columbia Valley. It's 100% varietal as aromas of char, toast, black cherry meats, herb, cranberry and spice are followed by elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of heft and grip.
