This is a concentrated, fairly full and lush Chenin, rich in toasty oak and vanilla cream as well as notes of baked apple pie and sweet orange. The medium-weight palate is mouthfilling and satisfying, with ample acidity to lift the decadent flavors. Notes of clove, anise and toasted nuts mingle on the lingering finish. Drink nowâ€“2019.
