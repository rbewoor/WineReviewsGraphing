A stony, flinty character leads the nose of this blend of 54% Sauvignon Blanc and 46% Sémillon, followed by scents of ripe peach, nectarine, freshly dried grass and herbs. The medium-weight palate offers more clean fruit flavors that result in a smooth, slightly creamy mouthfeel. Ample acidity lends freshness to the finish, alongside a lingering yellow flower character. Drink now–2019.
