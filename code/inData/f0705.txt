This rich and impressive wine has structure and a firm texture, partly from the Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend (45% Grenache, 35% Syrah, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon). It is dense and full of juicy red fruits, caramel and delicious spice. Production is only 2,500 cases. It would be worth aging for a few more months, so drink from late 2015.
