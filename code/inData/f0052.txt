This is much different than Casa Silva's 2009 Petit Verdot, which was tasted in the same flight. The '08 is more hard, spicy and tarry, with a leafy, herbal aroma, plus some grittiness. The palate feels snappy, with a can't-miss saltiness. The finish is long in length but short on fruit, with a raw feel.
