Mildly minty and woody on the nose, with grass, wintergreen and cheese aromas as well as red fruit. The palate is tight and grabby, with a blast of citric acid that gives the plum and raspberry flavors a tart, decidedly “red” personality. Snappy and crisp on the finish, making it a fresh, lean style of Cabernet.
