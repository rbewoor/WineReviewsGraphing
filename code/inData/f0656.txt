This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around. Very fresh in aroma, it's slightly yeasty like freshly fermented wine, and with subtly gorgeous cherry and blackberry flavors layered with light cedar and cocoa spiciness. Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork.
