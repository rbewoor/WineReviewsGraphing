The winery's larger bottling of the variety, one it has mastered for decades, this wine is a mix of baked plum and rustic leather notes. It's softly tannic, with pronounced jolts of tobacco and black pepper. With small amounts of other Rh√¥ne varieties, from Syrah to Viognier, it meanders to the finish, with a distinct trace of minerality.
