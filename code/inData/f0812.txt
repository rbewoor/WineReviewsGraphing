White blossom perfume accents notes of fresh lemon, lime and green melon in this aromatic Silvaner. While dry in style, it's refreshingly juicy on the palate, bursting with pristine citrus flavor tinged by edges of lime and lemon pith. Mouth filling and rich in texture, it clings lusciously through a long finish.
