At the first it was quite muted and subdued, but over a ten minute period it developed beautifully in the glass. The dark fruit is still dominant, but it is beginning to show some interesting tertiary aromas of earth, mushrooms and leather. Well balanced with a medium finish. Needs a few more years, but can be enjoyed now with a good deal of pleasure.
