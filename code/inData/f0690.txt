From vineyards in the high-desert Cuyama Valley comes this blend of 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Tempranillo, 20% Grenache and 15% Petite Sirah. On the nose, it shows chopped fresh mint, rose blossoms, fennel, black cherries and teriyaki beef jerky. Black pepper and soy mark the palate, along with blackberry juice and a slate-driven minerality.
