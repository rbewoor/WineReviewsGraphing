Yields tend to be low in this dry-farmed vineyard, which especially struggles during a drought, but the quality is fantastic. Aromas of browned toast, popcorn, Meyer-lemon pith, honey pollen and a mineral herbal chamomile character show on the nose. A vibrant chalkiness reveals itself on the sip, with lemon blossom and grapefruit pith keeping the palate tight, grippy and texturally zippy.
