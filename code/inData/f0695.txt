This is a well-balanced, well-structured white wine that's sure to evolve through 2020, at least. It's certainly attractive now, with subtle toasty notes of sweet spice and wood-grilled apple alongside hints of kiwi, sweet grass, green plum and lime. The medium-weight palate offers ample acidity and a streak of minerality that keeps things fresh and lifted through the softly spiced finish.
