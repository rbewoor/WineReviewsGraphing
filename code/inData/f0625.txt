Named after the Nez Perce name for the Clearwater River, this blend is mostly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Cabernet Franc and Syrah thrown in the mix. The aromas are light, with notes of berry and sweet spices. The cherry flavors are very soft, getting a bit attenuated on the back half on this otherwise pleasant red.
