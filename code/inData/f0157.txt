Approachably fruity yet nuanced and electrifying, there's exceptional value here. High-intensity flavors of tangerine and stone fruit sweeten the palate, balanced by nerve-tingling acidity and deep ripples of slate, salt and honeycomb. It's an intensely zesty wine, but the finish has length and power.
