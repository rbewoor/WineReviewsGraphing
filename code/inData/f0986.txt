Coconut and dill aromas rise from the nose, and they are surrounded by berry, cassis and floral scents. The palate is tight, honest and a little hard, with middle-of-the-road berry flavors tinged with herbs. There's size and power to this wine, but also balance. Compared to previous years, it's a little less generous but still a good way to go.
