Compelling minerality on the nose, Refined and focused floral aromas with ample ripe stone fruit and a hint of petrol. Racy acidity and lovely taut palate with generous layers of juicy ripe peach, apricot and nectarine.  Strong minerality prevails across the palate leading to a lingering finish. Very balanced.
