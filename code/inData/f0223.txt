Chopped herb, forest floor, leather, espresso and a balsamic note are some of the aromas that waft out of the glass. The powerfully structured palate delivers prune, dried cherry, tobacco, and roasted coffee bean framed in firm fine-grained tannins. Give the tannins a few more years to unwind then drink to capture the fruit richness. Drink 2018â€“2023.
