Black cherry, black plum and black currant are integrated well into the fresh dill and smoke scents on the nose of this wine from one of the region's newest properties. It discloses a rich dark-chocolate sauce character on the palate as well as black-currant-jelly flavors, but most impressive is the lush, sexy and soft mouthfeel.
