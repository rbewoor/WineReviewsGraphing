This is big boisterous wine from Elias Fernandez and Doug Shafer that has been given some nice time in bottle after four years in new French oak. It's a viscous, black-as-night kind of experience. Coconut macaroon and juicy blackberry and blueberry substantiate structured, integrated tannin, finishing with an unexpected elegance.
