Dry, spicy aromas of tobacco, cedar, vanilla and berry fruits come together nicely. This Maule Valley Cab is fresh and harmonious across the palate, with nothing too pushy. Complex, balsamic flavors of olives, herbs, dried berries, turned earth and cocoa finish dry, peppery and elegant. Drink through 2019.
